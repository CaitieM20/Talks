## Abstract
The Stateless Service design principle has become ubiquitous in the tech industry 
for creating horizontally scalable services.  However our applications do have state, 
we just have moved all of it to caches and databases.  Today as applications are 
becoming more data intensive and request latencies are expected to be incredibly 
low, weâ€™d like the benefits of stateful services, like data locality and sticky 
consistency.  In this talk I will address the benefits of stateful services,
how to build them so that they scale, and discuss  distributed and scalable
services in the real world that implement these techniques successfully.
